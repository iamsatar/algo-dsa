### Problem
  
* As a developer, you are tasked with improving a tech-savvy restaurantâ€™s reservation system.
* Your mission: fix a bug in the transposeSeating function that rearranges seating charts.
* Inspect the provided JavaScript code and correct it to ensure the seating layout is properly transposed.
* Analyze the code, identify the error, and adjust the function.


### Solution

```js
    // TODO: Fix the function to transpose a seating arrangement represented as a 2D array
function transposeSeating(seating) {
    let rows = seating.length;
    let cols = rows > 0 ? seating[0].length : 0;
    let transposed = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < cols; ++i) {
        transposed[i] = [];
        for (let j = 0; j < rows; ++j) {
            transposed[i][j] = seating[j][i];
        }
    }

    return transposed;
}

// Sample restaurant seating arrangement represented as a 2D array
let restaurantSeating = [
    [10, 11, 12],
    [20, 21, 22]
];

// Trying to transpose the seating arrangement
let transposedSeating = transposeSeating(restaurantSeating);

for (let row of transposedSeating) {
    console.log(row.join(' '));
}
// Output isn't as expected. Can you identify the fix?
```
